Deploy for development
----------------------

This project uses pip to manage the package. If you want to work on the
project yourself you can create the necessary links via::

    $ pip3 install --user -e .

That will install a backlink ~/.local/bin/srt to this project. Now you are
able to call it from anywhere.
