Hello RT-list!

I'm pleased to announce the {new_version} stable release.

You can get this release via the git tree at:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git

  branch: {branch_name}
  Head SHA1: {branch_head}

Or to build {new_version} directly, the following patches should be applied:

  https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v{major}.x/linux-{major}.{minor}.tar.xz

  https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v{major}.x/patch-{major}.{minor}.{patch}.xz

  https://www.kernel.org{prj_dir}/patch-{new_version}.patch.xz


You can also build from {old_version} by applying the incremental patch:

  https://www.kernel.org{prj_dir}/incr/patch-{old_version}-rt{new_tag_rt}.patch.xz

Enjoy!
